1.	A brief description of your GitHub account – The GitHub profile tells people the story of your work through repositories and lists you’ve pinned.

2.	A brief description of the repository you created – I can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open-source projects. With open-source projects, you can share code to make better, more reliable software. You can create public repositories for an open-source project. When creating your public repository, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want the project to be shared with others.
